# Numerical-Analysis

This is a series of Jupyter notebooks using Julia for a standard introductory (first semester) Numerical Analysis or Numerical Mathematics course for STEM students.

The notebooks can be used three ways:

1. Read the notebooks using [Jupyter notebook viewera](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/github.com/ivanslapnicar/Numerical-Analysis/tree/master/notebooks/).

2. Run the notebook on your computer:
  * install [Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/)
  * in Julia terminal add the package IJulia (using Pkg; Pkg.add("IJulia"))
  * clone this repository from GitHub to your computer

  If you are unfamiliar with GitHub, check the [GitHub help pages](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/).

3. Run the notebooks in [JuliaBox](https://juliabox.com/).
